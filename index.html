<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Prostatitis</h1>
<h3><marquee>Prostatitis is a group of conditions that includes acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS).</marquee></h3>
<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">



<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Autoimmune diseases.</li>
     <li>Pelvic floor muscle spasms.</li>
<li>Stress.</li>
<li>Bladder infections or bladder stones.</li>
<li>Surgery or biopsy requiring use of a urinary catheter.</li>
<li>Prostate stones.</li>
<li>Urinary retention (not emptying the bladder completely).</li>
<li>UTIs.</li>

	<h3 class="third">SYMPTOMS</h3>
<p>Men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome or chronic bacterial prostatitis may experience:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pain in the penis, testicles or perineum (area between the testicles and rectum). The pain may radiate to the lower back.</li>
<li>Frequent urge to urinate.</li>
<li>Painful urination (dysuria).</li>
<li>Weak urine flow or urine stream that starts and stops.</li>
<li>Painful ejaculation or pain during intercourse.</li>
<li>Blood in semen (hematospermia).</li>
<li>Erectile dysfunction.</li>
	
</ul>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
<p>Less invasive tests for prostatitis may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Digital rectal exam: Your provider inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to check the prostate gland for pain and swelling. This exam may include prostate massage to collect a sample of seminal fluid.</li>
	<li>Urinalysis: A urinalysis and urine culture check for bacteria and UTIs.</li>
	<li>Blood test: A blood test measures PSA, a protein made by the prostate gland. High levels may indicate prostatitis, BPH or prostate cancer.</li>
	<li>Cystoscopy: A cystoscopy can look for other urinary tract problems but does not diagnose prostatitis. Your provider uses a cystoscope (a pencil-sized lighted tube with a camera or viewing lens on the end) to view inside the bladder and urethra.</li>
	<li>Transrectal ultrasound: Men with acute bacterial prostatitis or chronic bacterial prostatitis that doesn’t improve with antibiotics may get a transrectal ultrasound. A slender ultrasound probe inserted into the rectum uses sound waves to produce images of the prostate gland. This test can show prostate gland abnormalities, abscesses or stones.</li>
</ul>

	<h3 class="third">TREATMENTS</h3>
<p>Prostatitis treatments vary depending on the cause and type. Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis doesn’t require treatment.</p>
<p>For chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), your healthcare provider may use a system called UPOINT to classify symptoms into six categories. Your provider uses multiple treatments at the same time to treat only the symptoms you’re experiencing.</p>
<p>Approximately 80% of men with CPPS improve with the UPOINT system. The system focuses on these symptoms and treatments:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Urinary: Medications, such as tamsulosin (Flomax®) and alfuzosin (Uroxatral®), relax muscles around the prostate and bladder to improve urine flow.</li>
	<li>Psychosocial: Stress management can help. Some men benefit from counseling or medications for anxiety, depression and catastrophizing (over-reaction to minor stresses common in people with chronic pain).</li>
	<li>Organ: Quercetin and bee pollen supplements may relieve a swollen, inflamed prostate gland.</li>
	<li>Infection: Antibiotics kill infection-causing bacteria.</li>
	<li>Neurologic: Prescription pain medicines, such as amitriptyline (Elavil®) and gabapentin (Gralise®), relieve neurogenic pain. This pain can include fibromyalgia or pain that extends into the legs, arms or back</li>
	<li>Tenderness: Pelvic floor physical therapy may include myofascial release (gentle massage to ease tension on tight pelvic floor muscles). This therapy can reduce or eliminate muscle spasms.</li>
</ul>
